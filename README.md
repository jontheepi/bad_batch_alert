# Baltimore Bad Batch Alert Project

Hello, and welcome to the Baltimore [Bad Batch Alert](http://www.badbatchalert.com/) project! This project is dedicated to the memory of Rachel Vicary, who lost her life in the stuggle with opioid addiction. It has been [featured on a number of prominent news outlets](http://www.badbatchalert.com/press/) including *The Washington Post* and *Vice News*. 

# What?

The [Baltimore Bad Batch Alert](http://wwww.badbatchalert.com) project was built to notify opiate users of trends in the medical and law enforcement communities that would otherwise not be publicized, like an increase of overdoses related to heroin being cut with fentanyl in their local area.

It's also a tool that aims to help those struggling with addiction in the Baltimore area get the treatment they need, and point them towards services like clean needle exchanges and free treatment services for addiction.

# Why?

Today we live in the height of the opium epidemic in America, with a good deal of addicted Americans not knowing if their opiates have been cut with a stronger and more deadly drug named fentanyl, which can be 50x-100x stronger than heroin itself. This has lead to a massive increase in addictions (and by extension deaths), especially in impoverished communities.

Somewhere between 60,000 and 65,000 Amercians died of an overdose in 2016, and with the new trend of dealers cutting their heroin with stronger drugs like fentanyl, they're expected to rise for this and next year as well.

Overdoses are now the [leading cause of death for Americans under the age of 50.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/overdoses-are-leading-cause-of-death-americans-under-50/). This is a problem that more and more Americans are having their lives destroyed by, and it's becoming scarce to find an American who hasn't had their lives affected by this crisis.

# How?

The Baltimore Bad Batch Alert service is a free and anonymous service that communicates over text message and can be thought of as an "amber alert" for an increase in overdose deaths in specific regions.

It's an express.js based app that uses Twilio for the communication aspect, and Heroku for running.
